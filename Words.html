<h2>Cool Vocab Words</h2>
  <p>What is this page? It looks like just a bunch of words. It is! This is a list of new or unique vocabulary words I have learned from watching tv shows...TV shows? Yes. I watch shows with the captions on because I wanted to see which words were being written into scripts. This has helped me become a better screenwriter myself by increasing my vocabulary. I will continue to update this list of words whenever I come across a new word I'm not 100% sure about or it's different. This is a collection of about five years of words, not just a binge watching weekend. Can you determine which genres I watch based on these words?</p>
