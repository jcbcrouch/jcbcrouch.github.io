	<u><h2>Search Engine</h2></u>
  <p>Description: Under construction. Me and a team of four other University of Michigan students are building a search engine from the ground up! This is a class project from 398 System Design of a Search Engine taught by <a href="https://nicolehamilton.com/">Nicole Hamilton</a> who worked on the creation of Microsoft's Bing.</p>
  <h5>Details</h5>
  <p>There are seven parts to a search engine. Crawler, HTML parser, Inverted index, Ranker, Query Compiler, Constraint Solver and Front end. For my part I implemented an ad-hoc html parser that could extract text in title and anchor tags, as well as regular body text. I ignored script tags because we were not allowed to use annyone else's libraries and making a javascript interpreter was more work than needed. The basic idea was to have a "global" file pointer that began at the beginning of the file and traverse through it, finding <i>a</i> and <i>title</i> tags while ignoring <i>style</i> and <i>script</i> tags. <br> I also implemented the query compiler, which interpreted different queries using a simple top-down recursive method.</p>
  <br>
  <u><h2>Instagram Web App</h2></u>
  <p>Description: An Instagram clone implemented with client-side dynamic pages deployed using AWS. Built using client-side dynamic pages and a REST API with a client application written in JavaScript that runs in the browser and makes AJAX calls to the REST API. </p>
  <h5>Details</h5>
  <p>Me and a partner implemented infinite scrolling, sessions, and secure passwords with hashing + salting. I mostly worked on the backend and database querying, but also did some work frontend work with pagination, layout and rendering.</p>
  <br>
  <u><h2>Creative AI</h2></u>
  <p>Description: A program to computer-generate realistic song lyrics and musical scores. My program uses machine learning techniques from natural language processing, which is at the intersection of computers and human language, to generate new songs and music based on patterns found in existing songs and music. The music databases used are the Beatles catalog and Nintendo music. This project taught me how to work with python and its different libraries. I also learned basic NLP techniques. I enjoyed this project because it combined coding with music.
 </p>

  <u><h2>Virtual Stock Exchange</h2></u>
  <p>Description: A program​ market that receives a series of “​orders​,” or intentions to buy or sell shares of a certain stock and checks if the new order can be matched with any previous orders. There are different ouptut modes. <strong>Median:</strong> prints the current median​ match price for all stocks in ascending order by stockID.  <strong>Trader Info:</strong> prints Trader​ __TRADER_ID__ bought​ __NUMBER_BOUGHT__ and sold __NUMBER_SOLD for a net transfer of ​​$​__NET_VALUE_TRADED__.<strong>Time Traveler:</strong> prints the ideal time that a time traveler theoretically could have bought shares​​ of​​ a ​​stock ​​and​​ then​​ later​​ sold​​ that​​ stock​​ to​​ maximize​​ profit.</p>
  <h5>Details</h5>
  <p>This project required the use of priority queues.</p>
<br>
<u><h2>Euchre</h2></u>
  <p>Description: A four player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchre">Euchre</a> simulator.</p>
  <h5>Details</h5>
  <p> I gained experience with abstract data types, object-oriented programming, and polymorphism.</p>
  <br>
<u><h2>Machine Learning Classifier</h2></u>
  <p>Description: A program that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automatically identify the subject of posts from the EECS 280 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_(web_service)">piazza</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <u><h2>Log Manager</h2></u>
  <p>Description: In professional software, rather than outputting messages to the   standard output stream (stdout via cout) for the purpose of debugging or indicating errors, developers will typically use log files to hide such information from end-users. These log files have the advantage of being archivable for later examination should an anomaly occur in the software system. Log files are usually quite massive in size and there are often many log entries that may be irrelevant to what the developer is trying to examine. The developer needs to have the ability to quickly search for and analyze only the entries they care about. My program helps with this task by being an interactive interface where the user can perform timestamp, category, and keyword searches for  the purpose of constructing an "excerpt list" of the log file. My program also allows the user to manage and display this "excerpt list" to identify the important/relevant entries of their log file.</p>
  <h5>Details</h5>
  <p> I gained experience writing code that makes use of multiple interacting data structures.</p>
  <br> 
  <u><h2>HTTP Server</h2></u>
  <p>Description: A http server that creates a thread per request connecting to clients through sockets. Parses client requests and serves requested files to client.</p>
  <br>
  <u><h2>ROP Chain Buffer Overflow</h2></u>
  <p>Description: A buffer overflow exploiter that chains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">ROP gadgets</a> together in order to load and execute attacker's own shell script.</p>
  <br>
  <u><h2>Port Scanning Detector</h2></u>
  <p>Description: A program that can detect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_scanner">port scanning</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <u><h2>Elliptic Curve Encryptor/Decryptor</h2></u>
  <p>Description: A program that can perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography">elliptic curve cryptography</a></p>
  <br>
  <u><h2>SQL Injection Program</h2></u>
  <p>Description: A program that can perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">sql injection</a> and bypass user logins on websites that don't properly sanitize user input and use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5 hash</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <u><h2>Image Processing</h2></u>
  <p>Description: A seam carving alogirthm. Seam carving is a technique for content-aware resizing of images (sometimes known as "retargeting"). The end result is that we can resize images in a way that changes the aspect ratio but does not distort the image. The algorithm works by finding and removing "seams" in the image that pass through the least important pixels. My program only implements shrinking the dimensions of an image. For more info on seam carving, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NcIJXTlugc">this</a> youtube video. Or read up on it <a href=" http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1276390">here</a>.</p>

  <u><h2>TSP Zookeeper</h2></u>
  <p>As a zookeeper in a zoo with a bunch of animals, everyday the zookeeper should provide food and water for the animals. In order to minimize the expenses of the zoo, it's necessary to devise a systematic way to feed the animals. The plan is to first make paths to each animal cage to deliver food, and then to construct canals to provide fresh water to all animal cages. My program identifies the most efficient routes for providing​​ food​​ and​​ water​​ to​​ the​​ animals. It has two modes. The first, is a simple MST to make paths to the cages to feed the animals minimizing the expenses of building paths by finding the most efficient routes. The second mode, is a more true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">TSP</a> problem where I find the most cost efficient routes for constructing water canals to the cages. In order to have water flow within the canals, the​​ route​​ should​​ be​​ a ​​cycle. Calculates the MST cost for 40,000 cages and TSP cost for 40 cages.</p>
  <h5>Details</h5>
  <p> Implemented an MST using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm">Prim's</a> algorithm instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm">Kruskal's</a> because the graph was sparse and contained many more edges than vertices making its Big O faster. Learned about branch and bound method and applying heuristics.</p>
